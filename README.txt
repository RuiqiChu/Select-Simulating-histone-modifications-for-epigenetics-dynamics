# This code is used in my Summer Project to simulate the interaction between polymer chain, reader-writer pairs and transcription factors(TFs)
# In the 'Running' folder is the code with a sample initial condition with 2000 polymer beads, 2 TFs and 100 reader-writer pairs
# To get other initial conditions, go to the 'simple_polymer_ic_DumbellProts' folder, then type the following in the terminal:

./generate_polymer.cc

# Then type the initial conditions you want, after this the code will generate a initial condition file in 'lammps.input', copy the context in this file and paste it to the 'equilibrated.lammps.1' in the 'Running' folder
# Following instructions can be seen in the README file in 'running' folder
